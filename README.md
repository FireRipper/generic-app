## Task description
The main goal of the task is to create a widget with a choice of user type and a form for confirming the
user agreement.

to adapt the responsive layout for **tablet** and **mobile** resolutions to look good based on his/her own
common sense and feel of beauty. Header is an important thing to do, at least the visual part of its
implementation.
